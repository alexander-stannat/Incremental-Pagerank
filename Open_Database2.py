	Class to open the multichain data set file consisting of tables, comprising the columns: type,
	tx (a dictionary containing the amount of up- and downloaded data), public_key, sequence_number_requester,
	public key responder (link public key), link sequence number, previous hash, signature, block timestamp,
	insert time and block hash

	A directed graph is then generated with nodes corresponding to the public_key of peers in the network and edges
	representing interactions between individual peers. The weight of an edge connecting to peers is determined by
	the net flow of data in between these peers. The direction of an edge is determined by the sign of the net flow,
	i.e. if a has transferred 3GB to b and b has transferred 1GB to a, then the graph will have a directed edge from
	a to b of weight 2GB.
